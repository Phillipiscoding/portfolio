        <p>
          I am a Fronted Developer with a Bachelors Degree from Full Sail University. If a day goes by without learning something new, I feel that day was a waste.

        In terms of frontend development, I possess a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Furthermore, I have attained proficiency in SASS and React, showcasing my excellence in these areas. Although I excel in utilizing Bootstrap and Tailwind frameworks, I take immense pleasure in crafting my own CSS libraries. While frontend development remains my primary focus, I also possess extensive experience working with APIs and databases, including MongoDB, MySQL, and Postgres. I derive immense satisfaction from constructing CRUD applications and developing RESTful APIs.
