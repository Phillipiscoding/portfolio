### What makes for an effective portfolio?

Many factors go into creating an effetive portfolio. For starters, a memorable domain name can go a long way. If someone is interested in you then it should be easy for them to remeber how to find you again later. Your portfolio needs to be clear and have a user friendy design. If people have a hard time navigating your portfolio then chances are they will move on without veiwing your work. 

Branding youself is important as a Junior Developer with no prior experience. "Building a brand is essential for building trust and credibility as a web developer. Branding isn’t just about attractive design – it’s about communicating your values to future clients and employers." Your doamin name is part of your branding. It is important to be consistent throughout the web using the same keywords or handle names to help people find you no matter which platform they choose to use. Branching off of that, it is important to include your socual media links on your portfolio, including sites such as GitHub that can help display your previous work and projects. 

When creating a portfolio, it is essential to include projects completed either individually and as part of a team. However, it is crucial to avoid overwhelming the portfolio with an excessive number of projects since most individuals tend to focus on only one or two. Instead, it is a better idea to showcase a select few projects that you are proud of, ensuring they reflect the coding languages relevant to the job you are seeking. This approach offers a more strategic and effective plan for presenting your skills and accomplishments.

Whether your portfolio is one page, or multiple pages, the pages or sections that are a must to include are your bio, contact information and/or contact form, your resume, your projects and experience, 



A bio, or "about me" section, is important to tell the viewers a little about youself. In my case it is important to list some hobbies or other activities that will tell a story of who I am and show my personality, as my target audience is smaller start up companies.

# My Plan
<br>
Since I do not possess a pre-existing portfolio, I will be starting everything from scratch. 

### Code Stack
 The coding languages that i plan to use are React and SASS for my frontend. And Node, Express and MySql for the backend.
 
### Color Theme
My intention is to maintain a clean and uncluttered color scheme that avoids overwhelming the viewers' eyes with excessive brightness. Instead of a plain white background, I will opt for an off-white color or a very light gray. As for buttons and links, I will utilize a blue color. Additionally, I might incorporate an orange accent color to highlight key words and other important elements. As a big fan of dark mode, I will also incorporate a dark mode feature into the project.

### Layout
Regarding the layout, since I am utilizing React, I will incorporate Router and prioritize navigation to ensure that viewers can easily navigate to their desired sections.

### Projects
The projects I intend to present are my most recent works. Among them, I will feature my capstone project from the previous two classes, called Lift Phit, which serves as a workout tracker. Additionally, I will showcase a previous project in which I incorporated multiple APIs, namely Spotify and an exercise database. To avoid overwhelming with too many projects, my third and final presentation will be a website for a pizza restaurant. This particular project was inspired by the simplistic non-functioning website of my favorite local pizzeria.
